.SYNOPSIS
    Audits Windows Security Event Logs for suspicious file access to help meet HIPAA requirements.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script queries the Security Event Log for Event ID 4663 (An attempt was made to access an object)
    to identify and flag potential unauthorized access to sensitive file paths. It is designed to help
    administrators and compliance officers satisfy the HIPAA Security Rule's requirement for
    "Information System Activity Review" (ยง 164.312(b)).

.PARAMETER Path
    An array of full directory paths to monitor for access (e.g., "D:\PatientRecords").

.PARAMETER Hours
    Specifies how many hours back from the current time to search the event logs. Defaults to 24.

.PARAMETER BusinessHoursStart
    The start of business hours in HH:mm format (e.g., "08:00"). Access outside this window is flagged.

.PARAMETER BusinessHoursEnd
    The end of business hours in HH:mm format (e.g., "17:00"). Access outside this window is flagged.

.PARAMETER AuthorizedGroups
    An array of Active Directory group names considered authorized. Access by users not in these groups is flagged.

.PARAMETER ReportPath
    The full path, including filename, where the CSV report will be saved.

.EXAMPLE
    .\HIPAA-File-Access-Auditor.ps1 -Path "D:\PHI", "E:\Billing" -AuthorizedGroups "ClinicalStaff", "BillingDept" -ReportPath "C:\Audits\today.csv"
